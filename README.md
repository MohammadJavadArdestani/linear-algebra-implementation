## Echelon Form
   This project gets a square matrix (A) and a vector (b) then: 
   1. Transforming matrix to Row Echelon form (show results step by step).
   2. Transforming Row Echelon matrix to reduced Row Echelon form (show results step by step)
   3. Solving Ax=b equation which A is a n \* n matrix and b is a vector in R<sup>n</sup>
   

## Inveret a matrix by LU decomposition
   In this project  LU decomposition is used to calculated inverted matrix in efficient way. It contains:
   1. forward-substitution function for calculating L matrix
   2. backward-substitution fucntion for calculating U matrix
   3. LU decomposition function which speed up our calculation to solve Ax=b eauation 
   <a/>
   solve AX = I by LU decomposition to find Inverted matrix.

## hw05
   the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigen decomposition of a square normal matrix to any          m*n matrix, here we use it to compress a .PPM photo and plot it a lower resolution
