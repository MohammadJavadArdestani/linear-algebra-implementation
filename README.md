This repository contains AUT algebra course implementations 

## P1: Echelon Form
   This project gets a square matrix (A) and a vector (b) then: 
   1. Transforming matrix to Row Echelon form (show results step by step).
   2. Transforming Row Echelon matrix to reduced Row Echelon form (show results step by step)
   3. Solving Ax=b equation which A is a n \* n matrix and b is a vector in R<sup>n</sup>
   

## P2: Inveret a matrix by LU decomposition
   In this project, LU decomposition is used to calculate the inverted matrix efficiently. It contains:
   1. forward-substitution function for calculating L matrix
   2. backward-substitution function for calculating U matrix
   3. LU decomposition function, which speeds up our calculation to solve Ax=b equation 
   <a/>
   solve AX = I by LU decomposition to find the Inverted matrix.
   
## P3: Vector space
   This project takes a matrix as input and extracts the row, column, and Nullspace basis of the matrix using reduced Echelon form.
   

## P4: Linear Regression
  This project predict COVID-19-infected number by Linear regression and curve fitting. you can download the total_cases.csv  file from [here.](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/ecdc) 
   
   
## P5: Image compresseion 
   The singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigen decomposition of a normal square matrix to any          m*n matrix. Here we use it to compress a .PPM photo and plot it a lower resolution
